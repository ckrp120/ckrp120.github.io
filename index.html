			Welcome to my GitHub page! I am Keisha Rae P. Cadacio, but you can just simply call me "Keisha". To state the obvious, I am currently taking up Computer Science at UPLB. As much as being a Computer Scientist isn't exactly what I wanted as a profession, I do thoroughly enjoy some of its aspects. CMSC 22, a course which delves into the basics of Object-Oriented Programming, has to be one of my favorite subjects. As a visual learner, I enjoy dealing with the front-end aspect of a program and CMSC 22 has let me experience that. Since CMSC 22 is my favorite subject, it's no secret that my favorite programming language has to be Java. I can't exactly explain why, but whenever I use Java everything just seems to... click? I find it really fun and simple to use.

			Aside from being a Computer Science student, I can say that I'm a bit of a picky eater. This is most probably the reason why I'm so thin; although there is one exemption to the rule - cheesecakes. 
			<br/>

			When it comes to GE, Arts 1 has to be my favorite. I initially wanted to be a journalist/critic as I take delight in analyzing films and literature. Arts 1, thankfully, has let me experience my passion even just for a little bit.
